# FizzBuzzWithRefactor
A simple two-part assignment based on FizzBuzz

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository
2. Complete both part 1 and part 2
3. Create a pull request to submit your response

### Notes
- You are free to select any language and framework to implement this assignment. Be advised that we use C#, Java, and JavaScript quite widely and these languages may be preferred over others
- Assignments submitted as pre-compiled binaries (i.e. not human readable) will not be accepted

## Part 1

Create a program that:

- For numbers 1 through 100:
- For every number divisible by 3 print "fizz".
- For every number divisible by 5 print "buzz".
- For every number divisible by both 3 and 5 print "fizzbuzz".
- Otherwise print the number.

It is highly encouraged that you test drive your solution following [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles.

## Part 2

- Refactor you program to include the following:
- For every number that includes a 3 in it, print "fizz"
- For every number that includes a 5 in it, print "buzz"
- The previous fizzbuzz functionality must still work.

Again, it is highly encouraged that you test drive your solution using [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles.
